## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Get Hunter.io API Key

1. Sign up for a free account at [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/)
2. Free tier gives you 25 searches per month
3. Go to your [API settings](https://hunter.io/api_keys) to get your API key

### 3. Configure API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```
HUNTER_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Edit the `domains` list in [scraper.py](scraper.py) (around line 168) with your target companies:

```python
domains = [
    'stripe.com',
    'salesforce.com',
    'microsoft.com',
    # Add your companies here
]
```

Then run:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

### Output

Results are saved to `executive_emails.xlsx` (Excel format) with **two sheets**:

#### Sheet 1: "Executive Emails"

Contains successfully found executive contacts:

- Domain
- Company
- Email
- First Name
- Last Name
- Position
- Department
- Confidence Score
- BP Member (team member assignment)
- Parse Date (when the data was scraped)

#### Sheet 2: "No Results"

Tracks companies where no executive emails were found:

- Domain
- Company
- BP Member (team member assignment)
- Reason (why no emails were found)
- Parse Date (when the attempt was made)

The Excel file features:

- **Two separate sheets** for organized tracking
- **Styled headers** with blue background and white text
- **Auto-sized columns** for easy reading
- **Automatic duplicate detection** - won't add the same email or company twice
- **Append mode** - new data is added to existing file without overwriting
- **Smart filtering** - companies that get results won't be added to "No Results" sheet
